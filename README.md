### Molotov project

Create a bootable media from a WindowsÂ® 10 iso image.

The Molotov project aims to make it easy to create a bootable flash drive for Windows 10 installation. The script contained in this repository is just a backend, sooner or later we'll launch a graphical interface. Only CSM boot is supported by now.

## How to use

It is simple, just run the script with the necessary arguments:

    ./molotov -i <ISO_IMAGE> -d <DEVICE>

## How to install

For convenience for some users, there is a .deb package in the [releases' page](https://github.com/cizordj/molotov/wiki), which requires all necessary dependencies.

## Help wanted

This project needs people to package it for Debian and Fedora, if you are interested please contact me.
