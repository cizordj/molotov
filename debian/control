Description: bootable media creator from a Windows® 10 iso image
 The Molotov project aims to make it easy to create a bootable flash drive for
 Windows 10 installation. What you need is a Windows® 10 iso image which can be
 downloaded from Microsoft's website and a flash drive with at least 8Gb.
 This program may work in older versions of Windows as well, although it is
 not supported.
